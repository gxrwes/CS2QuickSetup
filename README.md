# CS2QuickSetup
# GXRWes csgo setup
## How to install
- clone git repo or just copy the files i guess
- enable console in cs2
- open console and type
    ```exec "config u want to exec"```
    for eg:
    ```exec a ```
## add to autostart
- open steam/libary
- rightclick on cs2
- go to properties
- then in "general" add this to the startup
    ```-exec a```
    i have added some extra startup stuff aswell in my startup, still need to reconfigure for cs2
    ```-novid -exec a -freq 144 -nojoy -high```
